# The Village Tap

The village tap is a news site designed for the community of a small, fictional Irish village. 

The site has been designed to allow the imagined community members to get up-to-date news about happenings in the village (traffic updates, wedding announcements, etc.) and to open up discussions about the site's articles, or just to create an open forum to talk about whatever they'd like their neighbours opinions on.
