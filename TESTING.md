## Validator Testing


### PEP8

All Python files in the forum and news apps, as well env.py and manage.py and settings.py have been passed through the Code Institute [PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) Linter.
All issues raised have been corrected, no more warnings for any of the python files.

### W3C

All pages have been passed through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) successfully save for one info being raised which have been left in the code:
* "Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.

### JSHint

The comments.js file has been passed through [JShint](https://jshint.com/) with one issue raised: 
* "Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (bootstrap)"


## Accessibility and Performance

### WAVE

The site has been tested using the [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to ensure best practices have been followed regarding aria labels, heading hierarchy, and contrast between page elements.
The following issues were revealed and then left unfixed:

1. Home page:

* Contrast Errors for header texts - WAVE did not into account that the text is over a darker background image so it compares the contrast to the light-grey background.
* Alerts - Skipped heading level - On the Article display cards there is an h2 and an h4 heading without an h3 between them. the choice to leave it as it is was made for stylistic consistency. Since the structure remains clear and logical for users, and the skipped level does not negatively impact usability, this was an intentional decision.

2. The Snug page:

* Contrast Errors for header texts - WAVE did not into account that the text is over a darker background image so it compares the contrast to the light-grey background.


### Lighthouse

Lighthouse was used to used to produce reports on performance and accessibility for both desktop and mobile versions of the site.
The first image displayed on the lest under each page name is the test result of the mobile device load performance.

## Bugs and Bug Fixes

1. 'The snug' forum page had no url path in the main urls.py file. 

      Added the missing URL path in the main urls.py so the forum page is actually accessible. Before this, it just wasnâ€™t showing up at all.

2. Modify  threads_page view so superuser can create and post threads from front-end without needing approval.

      Updated the threads_page view so if an admin posts a thread, it gets automatically approved instead of needing manual approval.

3. Thread model required a manual slug.

      Modified the Thread model so the slug is automatically generated from the title. Now, users donâ€™t have to enter it themselves.

4. Related article link wasnâ€™t showing up in threads.

      Adjusted the template so the related article URL actually displays under the thread. Before this, the data was there, but it wasnâ€™t being shown.

5. Logged-out users could stillsee forum threads.

      Updated threads_page.html to hide threads from logged-out users. Now, logged out users wonâ€™t see any forum content.

6. Fix NameError by prperly referencing and importing CATEGORY_CHOICES in article_list view.

      The CATEGORY_CHOICES variable wasnâ€™t properly imported, so Django was throwing a NameError. Fixed the import, and now it works as expected. 

7. Incorrect URL matching order in news/urls.py.

      Some URLs were being matched out of order, so Django was routing requests incorrectly. Fixed the sequence so everything points to the right views.

8. 'Add New Article' link was visible to non-admins.

      Added an {% if %} condition in base.html to only show the link to superusers, preventing regular users from seeing it.

9. Edit thread form was displaying automatically insead of waiting for a button click.

      The JavaScript and HTML werenâ€™t properly linked, so the form was showing up by default. Fixed it so the edit form only appears when the edit button is clicked.

10. Related article link was not clickable.

      The link was just being displayed as plain text instead of an actual hyperlink. Wrapped it in an 'a' tag so users can click it properly.

11. Redirect not previously imported in views.py.

      The redirect function was missing from imports, causing an error when trying to redirect users. Simply added from django.shortcuts import redirect, and it worked.

12. Non-admins could access the 'Create Article' page.

      Added a decorator to the create_article view so only superusers can access it. If a regular usser tries, they get redirected to the login page instead.

13. Edited thread submission wasn't working due to a pathing issue.

      The pathing issue was making it impossible to submit an edited thread correctly, I would get a 404 error every time. After trying to fix the broken structure for way too long, I have decided to create a completely separate edit_thread.html form and removed the JavaScript handling. Now, edits are submitted properly without any routng errors.
